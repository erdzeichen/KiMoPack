As can be seen from the results of the SVD (last plot in the RAW plotting) the independent extraction of the spectra using the usual approach $ U\\,\\times\\,\\sum\\,\\times\\,V^{T} = M$ leads to vectors that are extracted from the data only and not physically meaningfull. <br> \n",
    "1. KiMoPack is using a parametric model function **ta.mod** to prepare a \"concentration matrix\" $C(t)$.\n",
    "2. In the standard usage the spectral matrix (called \"DAC\" in KiMoPack) is then calculated with np.linalg.lstsq so that the calculated matrix **AC** is $C(t)\\,\\times\\,DAC(\\lambda)=AC$.\n",
    "3. Then an error matrix **AE** is calculated that is the difference between the (shaped) measured matrix **A** and the calculated matrix **AC**\n",
    "4. Then the parameter of the **ta.mod** are modulated to minimize the sum of the squared **AE**\n",
    "\n",
    "This fitting process has a huge amount of options that include the providing of external spectra. If a sufficient amount of external spectra are provided this fitting process changes into a linear combination analysis. named switches like \"ext_spectra_scale\", \"extt_spectra_shift\"or \t\t\"ext_spectra_guidechange how they are handled. <br>\n",

    "```\n",
    "or an externally provided **external fitting function** as are provided in the file \"function_library.py\" and summarized in \"Function_library_overview.pdf\". The provided external fitting functions include linear and non linear models that cover pretty much any of the possible models with 3 or 4 species including some vibrational models.<br>\n",
    "Most function know switches like \"background\" = fit the background, \"infinite\" = non decaying species, \"explicit_gs\" = make the bleach an explicit speci. <br> But in general the external function can be pretty much anything that is needed. It gets a time vector, (at which point the function should return an entrance) and a pardf = Dataframe with the parameter from the fitting point. **It is expected to return the C(t)** and anything else is free. <br> We will look into these functions a bit later in this tutorial. Important to mention is that there is no difference in how this is handled.\n",
