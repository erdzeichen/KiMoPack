Therefore, up to two windows including lower and upper boundaries for delay times and probe wavelengths (*e.g.* ```[1,10,500,700]```) can be defined. In that region the TA signals are integrated. The respective integrals of each scan are shown in an active plot. The scans to exclude from the average are selcted by right-click on the respective data points in the active window. \n",

    "This is the advanced usage of the tool. By using filending, all files with a different ending are rejected. The \"filename_part\" works similar and looks if a certain string is in the filename, so can one e.g. filter all files with \"ACN\" in the name. The save_name is a useful option to keep track of the files. without it the file would be saved as \"combined.SIA\". The \"list_of_scans\" could be used to give e.g. a series of numbers that should be the last part of the filename. This is mainly useful if the option \"return_list_of_names\" is selected. Then e.g. multiple different selection series can be combined. See the Manual for more information on its usage. "
